## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to understand the weather for Ohahu and what impacts it can have on a Surf and ice cream shop. W.Avy is an investor who has a passion for surfing, but due to his failed investment in the past on another island, we are doing an analysis for Ohahu to see if weather will have a detrimental impact on the business. 

To do this analysis, we looked at temperature and precipitation for the months of June and December to understand what weather impacts would be present between the two months.

## Results

### June and December
Between the two months, we had more data in the month of June with the June temperatures producing 1700 data points and December producing 1517 data points. The difference in these two data points is 10% of data between the two months, which should be noted when comparing the two months. For precipitation data we have 1574 and 1405 respectively creating a difference of about 10% here as well.

### Temperature
For the island of Ohahu, we can see that the lowest temperature during December is 56 degrees fahrenheit, which would be coldest time of the year. Then, the average temperature is 71 degress, which means that the temperature on this island is rather warm and would still have traffic for surf boards and ice cream. 

### Precipitation 
Once other obstacle for ice cream and surf boards would be precipitation as having either would slow down traffic for patrons who want either good. However, after doing an analysis of precipitation and temperature, the max rainfall between June and December differ by about 2 inches with December raining 2 inches more than June. Given this information, we can gather that precipiation would not be a factor to slowed traffic for the business during either month. Another value that woudl be valuable in looking into would be the average value for both months, and after an analysis, we can see that the average for June and December is .14 inches and .22 inches respectively.

## Final Summary

According to our analysis, we can see that temperatuve or precipitation will not impact the business negatively. There will not be a significant difference in traffic to the store in either month. The make a more thorough analysis of weather impacts, we went a step futher and looked at precipitation data and found that neither change of temperature or precipitation will impact a potential surf and ice cream shop negatively.
